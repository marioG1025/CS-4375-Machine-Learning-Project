# Sentiment Analysis and Text Classification Project

## Overview
This project focuses on building a text classification model to analyze sentiment from text data.<br>
We use datasets from multiple domains, including movies, e-commerce, restaurant reviews, and video games, to explore sentiment trends and evaluate classification techniques.

## Objectives
- Preprocess text data (e.g., tokenization, stop-word removal, lemmatization).
- Experiment with feature extraction techniques like Bag of Words (BOW) and Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF).
- Train and compare machine learning classifiers (e.g., Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, Random Forest).
- Evaluate model performance across different datasets.
